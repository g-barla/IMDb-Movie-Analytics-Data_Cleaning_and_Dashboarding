Software to use: ER Studio/Navicat, Azure ADF, Alteryx, Snowflake, Power BI or Tableau
This is an end-to-end implementation of the BI project, starting with data analysis, understanding data properties, analyzing the data using Alteryx/Python ydata profile, documenting, creating a mapping document (Make sure to unify the columns from both data sets), staging the data, cleaning data, loading it into the integration schema, and generating reports based on the integration schema. 

Business requirements are as follows:
As a Business Analyst, I should be able to - 

Get different types of professions for any given personnel (Primary and other professions if applicable)
Generate a report to find personnel who have more professions (Primary and other professions, if applicable)
Get the list of genres for a given title and identify a list of movies based on a given genre
Find all moves that are released in a given year
Track the movie length to generate metrics on movie length based on release year.
List all adult and non-adult movies
Generate all different languages in which a title is associated
Get a list of regions in which a move is released
Get the list of all directors and writers involved in making a movie so that I can identify the popular directors and writers
Get the number of episodes associated with a season for a given title
Find all different types of crew/cast, directors, writers, etc, for a given title
Get the list of jobs involved in a given title
Get a list of characters involved in a given title
Find top-rated movies by year, by genre
As a Team, create visualizations to fulfill the business requirements. For example, the following are for reference purposes only. Come up with comparison and analysis reports that adds value to the project)

Movie insights
Analysis based on Crew members (Actor, Director, backstage resources, writers, etc)
Movie trend analysis  based on ratings
Non-movie title analysis (Seasons and number of episodes comparison with ratings to understand what users like more)
Region and Country based movie releases
Details of the assignment are as follows:
There are seven zip files which contain details about
All cast members and behind-the-scenes personnel details - name.basics.tsv.gz
All movie title details and its genres - title.basics.tsv.gz
For a given title, this file gives a list of title names in multiple languages - title.akas.tsv.gz
Gets all Directors and Writers (This includes a complete list of directors and writers involved in a given title) - title.crew.tsv.gz
This file Includes the series title, season number, and episode number - title.episode.tsv.gz
Principal credits are a set of the most important cast/crew credits for a title, with the selection and order determined by IMDb. Principal credits are often similar to top-billed cast - title.principals.tsv.gz
Movie ratings and their votes are in this file - title.ratings.tsv.gz
Make sure to incorporate descriptions for Region and Language using the links below
Row counts of each file are as below
name_basics: 14195120
title_akas: 51409880
title_crew: 11464885

Deliverables:
Create a mapping document to source and target and include the different transformations used to perform the changes. 
ADF code must be on git, and we should see the team contributions (Create a new REPO that the respective team members will use)
Upload all the data profiling analysis document, data modeling design files, report files, pdf files, excel files, and ppt files, if any should be uploaded to Canvas 
Note:
There is no Extension to this midterm project. 
Understand the requirements and get all questions clarified before 7th March 2025.
You can clean up data using either Alteryx or ADF. Your choice
You must use SNOWFLAKE as a database
Try to incorporate medallion architecture
You can generate dashboards on any of the tools (Power BI or Tableau) without publishing the data.
